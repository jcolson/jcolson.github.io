This is a helpful tool that will allow you to see on your calendar of choice (ical, google cal, outlook, etc) your 'target' weight for the day while on a weight loss (cut) plan.  It's very simple, fill out the form and then submit it.  There will be a URL that you can copy (right click it and copy).  Then paste that URL into your calendar of choice's 'subscriber to calendar' feature.  Cheers and good luck on your cut!

_Site maintenance is in progress, so php won't be embedded any longer ... the source code for it is linked as iloss-ical-gen over here -> [software dev page](/software-dev) when I get to it._
