## CancerFit - (yeah, that's a play on CrossFit)
<p>I was diagnosed with pancreas cancer (Distal Cholangiocarcinoma to be exact) on August 23rd, 2018.  I had the Whipple procedure 
to remove the tumor and nodes affected on September 11th, 2018.  At this time (November 2018 until ?) I'm going through Folferinox 
chemotherapy treatments.</p>

<p>B.C. (before cancer) I was a very active, over 40 years old, athlete.  I practiced CrossFit or bodybuilding about 5-6 days every 
week.  I've lost a significant amount of muscle mass during this adventure (20+ kilograms); but I plan on getting it back.  I 
decided that I would start tracking my workouts during a very trying time for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>To make myself accountable for my own fitness and health as I have a hunch that there will be many other 'competing' priorities 
in the near future.</li>
<li>To share with others that are interested in what they may be capable of before, during and after the same types of treatment 
that I'll be executing (post Whipple surgery &amp; during FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy).</li>
</ol>
