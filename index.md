<p class="has-drop-cap">CancerFit - (yeah, that's a play on CrossFit).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was diagnosed with pancreas cancer (Distal Cholangiocarcinoma to be exact) on August 23rd, 2018.  I had the Whipple procedure to remove the tumor and nodes affected on September 11th, 2018.  At this time (November 2018 until ?) I'm going through Folferinox chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>B.C. (before cancer) I was a very active, over 40 years old, athlete.  I practiced CrossFit or bodybuilding about 5-6 days every week.  I've lost a significant amount of muscle mass during this adventure (20+ kilograms); but I plan on getting it back.  I decided that I would start tracking my workouts during a very trying time for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>To make myself accountable for my own fitness and health as I have a hunch that there will be many other 'competing' priorities in the near future.</li>
<li>To share with others that are interested in what they may be capable of before, during and after the same types of treatment that I'll be executing (post Whipple surgery &amp; during FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy).</li>

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
