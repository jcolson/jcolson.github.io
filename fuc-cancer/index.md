<p class="has-drop-cap">Recently being diagnosed with pancreas cancer, I had the desire to coerce my family into 
wearing silly clothing symbolizing the fight that exists in our <strong>team</strong>. This design is just geeky 
enough to make the cut. Binary on the back (with ascii translation in the far right column) and a human readable 
F-CANCER on the front. Sharing here purely for the fun of it.</p>
