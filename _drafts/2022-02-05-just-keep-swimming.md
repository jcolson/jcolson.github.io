description: Chemotherapy update ... been on the poison since September 11th, 2020

It's been a long while since I sent out an update (I think my last one was almost exactly a year ago), so I figured I'd pen one and get it out to everyone.

I've been on chemotherapy now, every two weeks, consistantly since September 1th, 2020.  The original cocktail stopped working around August of 2021, so my Oncologist (Professor McDermott) determined that I should move to another cocktail called "Liposomal Irinotecan".  I've been on that every two weeks since.

After my infusion on every other Wednesday, they hook me up to a pump of chemo that I then take home with me.  It continuously pumps it into my heart (through a **port**, shown on the right) until Friday and then I go back to the hospital to get the pump (gripper) removed.  I'm generally not very good on Friday/Saturday ... I just have to sit on the couch and work on my laptop, but then by Sunday I'm getting better and then I work out from Monday through Friday and then again Monday-Tuesday.  Then I go back and get chemo again on Wednesday and it starts all over ...  I'm slowly getting weaker and weaker, but I'm fighting it as hard as I can ;-)

I'm completely and utterly convinced that without my Angel (Denise, my loving wife and head coach) pushing me to workout every day that I possibly feel like I can (and some that I don't), I would not still be here.  It's very easy to give up and just sit on a couch, I can't let that happen.

The chemo has slowly been bringing my marker (CA-19.9) down - this is **GOOD**.  It was very high (about 3136) at the beginning of getting chemo in September of 2020, currently it's at about 560.  This, plus the scans that I get regularly indicate that the cancer is at a slow growth rate.  The pain that I'm in is very minimal considering how long I've been dealing with this.  I don't take any pain medications except for the occational paracetamol (acetaminophen or otherwise known as Tylenol) or ibuprofen.

Denise is kicking ass being a coach and a cancer patient driver for the Irish Cancer Society.  We try to keep active with hikes and visits to parks as much as possilble.  We've done some 'stay-cations' around Ireland, such a beautiful country.
