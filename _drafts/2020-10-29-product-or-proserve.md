description: Discuss focusing a company's energy on product roadmap or professional services
---

Software development professional services is a very large industry today, consisting of more than $20 billion in revenue.  There is no shame in developing a business that is primarily focused on professional services over developing a software "product".  There are a lot more niche' businesses than not in the world which require custom applications and support to solve specific business challenges over an 'out of the box' product solution which tries to solve many problems through 'configuration'.  That being said, it's also very common for a company to offer **both** products and services.

As for me, I've been in the software development industry for a long-ish time.  Not to give away my age or anything, but I was writing software on a Commodore PET at the age of six.  I've also worked for some great companies over the years, writing custom software solutions, as well as software products.

### Product or Pro-Serve

Depending on the market that exists for the software solution that is developed, it may be very easy to determine that there should be a standard 'product offering' or not.  If the target market is **B2C** based and very large, then it may make sense to productize.  The reason for this is that the product is built one time, for one expense and then can be packaged, licensed and sold an unlimited number of times for minimum additional investment.  If the market is **B2B** or **B2B**2C and requires significant customizations and/or branding in order to be licensed and deployed for a customer, it may make sense to keep the solution a professional services engagement.

When software is a product, it is very common for end users of the software to expect release cycles and roadmap publications.  It is also common for end users to expect a "voice of the customer", in which they have the ability to potentially affect the product roadmap by suggesting feature/functionality additions or changes.  This voice of the customer can come in many different forms.  From the most simplistic, such as an online ticketing system, to something a bit more elegant, like a yearly conference in which the company invites it's customers to attend.  It is **not** common for end users to expect custom implementation of requests.

So let's review a few **very** common software products.

* Microsoft Office - this is an extremely common B2C or B2B software product.  Microsoft develops Office as a product.  They sell both directly to consumers as well as to other businesses.  Office has a standard release cadence, as well as a roadmap that is shared.  Office allows for many customizations to it's suite, and Microsoft has a very large professional services arm that can be engaged to do customizations (of enterprise installs, custom integrations, etc).

* MS Office 365 - another very common product offering from Microsoft.  One of the most apparent professional services opportunities for O365 is migrations (from internally hosted Microsoft Exchange, or from other enterprise offerings).  There are also other integrations (such as above w/Office) that could be contracted for separately (outside of the actual product licensing).

Take notice that for both of the above examples, professional services doesn't actually change the core product.  The scope for professional services is simply for "bolting on" additional functionality, configuration or wholesale migration services.

Now let's take a couple of common professional services type engagements.

* Website development and design - an example of _purely_ custom implementation and development.  Generally, if a customer is looking for a website implementation, they will require very specific requirements and/or user stories to be implemented that relate to their business.

* SAP[](#SAP){: #SAP} - Enterprise Resource Planning applications are developed as multi-component (to support different business purposes such as Accounts/Receivable, Accounts/Payable, Payroll, Timecard tracking, etc) products that require Professional Services engagements to be implemented.  This means that the customer may pay for a 'seat licensing' to the product as well as pay for licensing of Ã  la carte components, however, there is also a mandatory professional services engagement that must be entered into as well, as they are so extremely complicated that only a team of people that understand the implementation and deployment details of the product would ever actually be successful at integrating and launching it for the customer.

### Real World

At [Synchronoss](https://www.synchronoss.com){:target="_blank"}, we've struggled with these concepts for a few of our products over the course of our realization of them.  I'll concentrate on our [Personal Cloud](https://synchronoss.com/products/cloud/personal-cloud-solution/){:target="_blank"} product, as I believe (and am closest to it) that it is the most interesting case for study.

With respect to Synchronoss's Personal Cloud product, we've developed a software product that has an "uber" customer using it, we'll call that customer _BigCo_.  BigCo drives most of our roadmap capacity.  This causes conflict within our Leadership and Product Management team, as we are constantly struggling to deliver roadmap features that aren't targeted directly at BigCo.  We get a lot of feedback from BigCo (as well as our other customers) that we don't deliver "other" roadmap features fast enough.

The root of the problem is that we, as a company, have decided to market ourselves to the Street as a software "product" company instead of a "services" company.  So we've tried extremely hard to pivot to a "product development" mindset, all the while not changing the desire to "chase the crack" (crack being "services" revenue) on a quarterly basis.  The reason we want the Street to look at us as a product company is simple.  The market cap multiples on software product companies are _much_ higher than services companies.

So, it seems, to actually pivot to a product type delivery model (_if that's really what is desired_) we would need to set Street expectations that would not necessarily be appealing.  In the meantime we echo internally (and externally) that we're a product company, but we are still trying to execute with a product, delivery and development staff that are focused on an ever-changing roadmap based on BigCo's whims and desires.

### Change or No Change

The change that actually needs to occur (_if that's really what is desired_):  Communicate to the Street of the upcoming changes and hits to services revenue that could potentially occur.  Hire and train the relevant staff that would help maintain a services revenue stream while pivoting the existing staff to deliver on a Product Management vision of the roadmap.

You'll notice that I mention "_if that's really what is desired_" a couple of times.  It's very possible that the services model _may be_ the correct one for our product.  Our product requires a substantial investment from the customer.  Even if you take the cost of hardware, maintenance and storage out of the equation (which you really can't) the customer still needs to invest significantly in marketing and campaigning.  Without end users signing up, there is zero revenue.

It would be great if our target customer base was as large as say, [SAP](#SAP)'s (above example).  That way we could easily afford to have a Product Management group focused on the core product **AS WELL** as standardized contracts with each of our customers for Professional Services engagements on top of that license revenue.  The roadblock to this is, as I mentioned, the Personal Cloud product requires significant investment from our Customer.  That means that it reduces our potential customer base significantly, there just aren't very many potential customers as large as BigCo.

If we reduce the potential customer base due to the "barrier of entry" of large investment dollars required, this then begs the question: "does it really make sense for us to concentrate on a large customer base by productizing our delivery method, or should we instead focus our energy on the BigCo customers and their desired features?"

What if we don't reduce the potential customer base?  How do we accomplish that?  We make a product that requires little or no onboarding, maintenance and support; it must be multi-tenant as well.  This way we can bring on as many customers as we want and as the customer adds end users, the revenue for the multi-tenanted solution grows.  Simple, right?

Our product is "front and center" for the end users of our customers.  This means that there are, undoubtedly, changes in branding, look & feel, etc.  So, in **theory** it's a good idea to have zero onboarding cost, but that will require a significant effort on the Product roadmap that will not result in any discernible new features for our customers (or their end users).  The product will need a zero-friction onboarding and launch control for deploying white-labeled Android, iOS, Windows, OS-X and Web clients for the customer with little to no interaction with our technical teams.

These all seem like challenges that can be resolved, but in the fog of war while running a public company, delivering great features for our customers, continuing to have fantastic support for the customers already deployed and keep our investors happy, the decisions that are required are not aligned with the happiness of all of the stakeholders.

### How We Did It

We decided to attack this space by moving to a product focused roadmap and attempt to address the largest customer base we could.  This meant a few things.  We needed a development methodology that would scale with the size of the teams required to both develop a product roadmap, as well as develop professional services for BigCo and our current customers.  We also needed to make serious choices in where to invest in our product lines.

Through the guidance of a third party we introduced a form of Scaled Agile to all of our teams at Synchronoss.  This allows us to make small, but significant, changes to our current Agile development teams.  The most significant change is leveraging Planning Increments.
