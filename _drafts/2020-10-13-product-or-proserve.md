Software development professional services is a very large industry today, consisting of more than $20 billion in revenue.  There is no shame in developing a business that is primarily focused on professional services over developing a software "product".  There are a lot more niche' businesses than not in the world which require custom applications and support to solve specific business challenges over an 'out of the box' product solution which tries to solve many problems through 'configuration'.  That being said, it's also very common for a company to offer **both** products and services.

As for me, I've been in the software development industry for a long(ish) time.  Not to give away my age or anything, but I was writing software on a Commodore PET at the age of six (6).  I've also worked for some great companies over the years, writing custom software solutions, as well as software products.

Depending on the market that exists for the software solution that is developed, it may be very easy to determine that there should be a standard 'product offering' or not.  If the target market is B2C based and very large, then it may make sense to productize.  If the market is B2B or B2B2C and requires significant customizations and branding in order to be sold and deployed for the customer, it may make sense to keep the solution a professional services engagement.

When software is a product, it is very common for end users of the software to expect release cycles and roadmap publications.  It is also common for end users to expect a "voice of the customer", in which they have the ability to potentially affect the product roadmap by suggesting feature/functionality additions or changes.  This voice of the customer can come in many different forms.  From the most simplistic, such as an online ticketing system, to something a bit more elegant, like a yearly conference in which the company invites it's customers to attend.  It is **not** common for end users to expect custom implementation of requests.

So let's review a few common software products.

* Microsoft Office - this is an extremely common B2C or B3B software product.  Microsoft develops Office as a product.  They sell both directly to consumers as well as to other businesses.  Office has a standard release cadence, as well as a roadmap that is shared.  Office allows for many customizations to it's suite, and Microsoft has a very large professional services arm that can be engaged to do customizations (of enterprise installs, custom integrations, etc).

* MS Office 365 - another very common product offering from Microsoft.  One of the most apparent professional services opportunities for O365 is migrations (from internally hosted exchange, or from other enterprise offerings).  There are also other intergrations (such as above w/Office) that could be contracted for separately (outside of the actual product licensing).

Take notice that for both of the above examples, professional services doesn't actually change the core product.  The scope for professional services is simply for "bolting on" additional functionality, configuration or wholesale migration services.

Now let's take a couple of common professional services type engagements.

* Website development and design - an example of _purely_ custom implementation and development.  Generally, if a customer is looking for a website implementation, they will require very specific requirements to be implemented that relate to their business.

* SAP - Enterprise Resource Planning applications are developed as componentized products that require Professional Services engagements to be implemented.  This means that the customer may pay for a 'seat licensing' to the product as well as pay for licensing of Ã  la carte components, however, there is also a mandatory professional services engagement that must be entered into as well, as they are so extremely complicated that only a team of people that understand the implementation and deployment details of the product would ever actually be successful at integrating and launching it for the customer.

At Synchronoss, we've struggled with these concepts for a few of our products over the course of our realization of them.  I'll concentrate on our Personal Cloud product, as I believe (and am closest to it) that it is the most interesting case for study.
