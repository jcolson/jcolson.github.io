Software development professional services is a very large industry today, consisting of more than $20 billion in revenue.  There is no shame in developing a business that is primarily focused on professional services over developing a software "product".  There are a lot more niche' businesses than not in the world which require custom applications and support to solve specific busines challenges over an 'out of the box' product solution which tries to solve many problems through 'configuration'.  That being said, it's also very common for a company to offer **both** products and services.

As for me, I've been in the software development industry for a long(ish) time.  Not to give away my age or anything, but I was writing software on a Commodore PET at the age of six (6).  I've also worked for some great companies over the years, writing custom software solutions, as well as software products.

Depending on the market that exists for the software solution that is developed, it may be very easy to determine that there should be a standard 'product offering' or not.  If the target market is B2C based and very large, then it may make sense to productize.  If the market is B2B or B2B2C and requires significant customizations and branding in order to be sold and deployed for the customer, it may make sense to keep the solution a professional services engagement.

When software is a product, it is very common for end users of the software to expect release cycles and potentially yearly roadmap publications.  It is also common for end users to expect a "voice of the customer", in which they have the ability to potentially affect the product roadmap by suggesting feature/functionality additions or changes.  It is **not** common for end users to expect custom implementation of requests.
