On March 14th, we added:
The Wine Pair
Idlewild Bar
BOTH allow your pooch inside!

We've been slowly accumulating map 'pins' in google maps over the past couple of years and I decided that it would be a good thing to share with the larger Dublin community.  Feel free to 'copy and modify' as you will.

If you would like to submit new additions, please do it [here](https://forms.gle/GTEG2gXKGMA3hsFx5){:target="_blank"}, and I'll incorporate them ASAP.

Last update was on December 3rd!  We've added a few more places!
