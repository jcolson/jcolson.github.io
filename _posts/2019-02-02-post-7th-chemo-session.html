<p>I didn&rsquo;t get an update out after my last ( #6 ) infusion - no great loss, there wasn&rsquo;t too much action missed.<br>I think 
    we've settled into a relatively good routine with the infusions. &nbsp;Denise and I are aware of all of the side effects and when 
    they start kicking in so that we can stay ahead of them for the most part (via medical countermeasures). &nbsp;The flow goes something like:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday, infusion day, nausea meds in full force, and cold sensitivity (gloves)</li>
<li>Thursday, still have infusion pump attached, stomach cramping, nausea meds in full force, and cold sensitivity</li>
<li>Friday, return infusion pump to hospital in the evening, stomach cramping, nausea meds in full force, cold sensitivity</li>
<li>Saturday, fuzziness (chemo brain) kicks in</li>
<li>Sunday, same</li>
<li>Monday, fuzziness cleared up for the most part, standard nausea issues</li>
<li>Tuesday, just nausea - and if I stay &ldquo;ahead&rdquo; of it with hard candies and medicine, it&rsquo;s completely manageable</li>
<li>Wednesday, my platelets are at their lowest today, so very susceptible to infection / etc - by the next Wednesday they should be built 
    back up for another infusion treatment.</li>
<li>Thursday -> Tuesday, primarily managing nausea and fatigue.</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

<p>The fatigue is cumulative for sure, week over week my energy levels have definitely decreased significantly. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve slowed 
    down to about 1 workout a week at this point on average.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>positive</strong>: &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve steadied my weight loss at this point and have been sustaining a weight of about 
    75-77 KG. &nbsp;This is still a primary concern of mine, making sure that I get enough nutrition in the &lsquo;ol body. &nbsp;
    Without working out regularly and the fact that my tastebuds are completely different now make it difficult to &lsquo;
    remember&rsquo; to eat. &nbsp;It seems that unless the food has some significant spice or sweetness to it, I don&rsquo;t 
    really taste too much.<br>I received a CT scan here in Dublin Wednesday the 16th and Professor McDermott reviewed it with me; 
    at this time there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any concerns! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s another&nbsp;<strong>positive</strong>! &nbsp;
    Denise and I will be heading to Houston in February for followup with Dr. Katz @ MD Anderson where I&rsquo;ll have another 
    CT scan so they can do a baseline comparison with my CT from MD Anderson post-op (Whipple). &nbsp;This will allow Dr. Katz 
    to exclude healing/scarring tissue and determine if there are any other differences that would be concerning.<br>In other 
    news,&nbsp;<strong>Connor</strong>&nbsp;got his first acceptance letter for University. &nbsp;Penn State Pre-Medical 
    acceptance! &nbsp;He&rsquo;s planning on waiting to see what offers he gets here in Europe (Royal College of Surgeons 
    Ireland is his #1 pick currently).<br><strong>Riley</strong>&nbsp;has been learning guitar (and getting pretty good), she 
    has weekly lessons starting today! &nbsp;For the next two weeks she&rsquo;ll be completing her &ldquo;Work Placement&rdquo; 
    for school, she&rsquo;s already done one week earlier this year at a local University, shadowing a Professor. &nbsp;The 
    first week she&rsquo;ll be working at Accenture and the following week she&rsquo;ll be working at Synchronoss! &nbsp;
    We&rsquo;ll put her to work for sure &#x1f609;<br>Once again, thank all of you that contributed to my &ldquo;Birthday 
    Fundraiser&rdquo; for MD Anderson. &nbsp;We raised&nbsp;&euro;2,282! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s awesome; I love all of you!</p>
