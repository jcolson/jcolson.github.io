<p>Dear Loving Friends and Family:<br>I can see the end of this leg of our journey, and I&rsquo;m very happy to announce that this round of chemotherapy is almost over! &nbsp;I believe the side effect that had the largest impact on my has been exhaustion, it will be so unbelievably amazing to not feel like I just want to sit on a couch all day. &nbsp;Watch out gym, it&rsquo;s going to be a mass-gaining summer! &#x1f642; &nbsp;Connor has committed that he&rsquo;ll be on the &lsquo;gainz-train&rsquo; with me this summer, lot&rsquo;s of bro-sessions coming.<br>My last chemotherapy for this round will be on Wednesday the 10th. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll most likely have a CT scan as well to compare to my last baseline and make sure that there are no additional&nbsp;metastasization. &nbsp;If all looks good, I&rsquo;ll be doing CT scans every few months to keep an eye on it, as distal cholangiocarcinoma is known to be persistent.<br>It&rsquo;s almost&nbsp;&rsquo;summer&rsquo; for the kids, and Riley will be done with &ldquo;4th year&rdquo; and&nbsp;Connor will complete his Leaving Certificate and&nbsp;&ldquo;6th year&rdquo;. &nbsp;Riley will be going to Spain to be immersed with a Spanish family for two weeks at the end of April and beginning of May (directly after&nbsp;Spring Break). Connor has been accepted to a few different Universities and he&rsquo;s still weighing his options, but the last time I checked he&rsquo;s leaning towards accepting at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.rcsi.com/dublin/" target="_blank">RCSI</a>&nbsp;(Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland).<br>I&rsquo;ll keep it short and sweet, but couldn&rsquo;t end without mentioning the newest member of the Colson family,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv6KUx7oOX_/" target="_blank">Xena</a>! Xena is our 3 month old baby Yorkie. &nbsp;If you know me, you know that I&rsquo;ve never been a &lsquo;dog person&rsquo;, however we baby sat the cutest dog ever (shout out to Kaia) and she &lsquo;changed&rsquo; me. &nbsp;Xena is unbelievably adorable and an amazing breath of fresh air, and it&rsquo;s wonderful to hear the entire family laughing and carrying on with her! &nbsp;She&rsquo;s getting very good at her potty training and has learned how to &lsquo;sit&rsquo; and &lsquo;stay&rsquo; (almost) already!!<br>Peace and Love,Riley, Connor, Denise &amp; Jay</p>
