<p>Just a real quick note.<br>I got the port installed yesterday (October 30th) and we were all hoping that I'd still make my first chemo appt today (31st), however, it got rescheduled.&nbsp; So now it looks like the first chemo treatment will be Friday the 2nd.<br>Just two more days.<br>Peace &amp; Love,Jay &amp; Denise</p>
