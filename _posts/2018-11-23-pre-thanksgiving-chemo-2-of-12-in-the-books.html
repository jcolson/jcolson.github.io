<p>Happy Thanksgiving (if you&rsquo;re celebrating, eating copious amounts of turkey and stuffing and watching a couple NFL games) to all of you amazing people!<br>I&rsquo;m thankful. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thankful for this amazing life that my mum and dad blessed me with. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thankful for the most beautiful and caring wife in the world. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thankful for my wonderful children who make me the proudest papa possible. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thankful for the most thoughtful family &nbsp;that I could possibly be so lucky to be related. &nbsp;Last, but definitely not least, I&rsquo;m thankful for the incredibly supportive friendships that have lit up different hours of different days over the past few months!<br>Chemo #2 went pretty well yesterday (Nov 21, 2018) &hellip; &nbsp;No major hickups yet, I&rsquo;m just a little bit nauseas. &nbsp;I think the Wednesday timing will definitely work out better for me longer term, as I get the &ldquo;chemo brain&rdquo; (general cognitive fuzziness) a few days after the treatment. &nbsp;So, the hope is that I&rsquo;ll get that on Saturday/Sunday and I can &ldquo;veg&rdquo; out on the couch, and then be &lsquo;ready to rock&rsquo; come Monday!<br>I received a few hints from friends and family in regards to nausea medications over the past few weeks. &nbsp;I mentioned to the medical staff that the Valoid wasn&rsquo;t really doing the trick for my nausea and they immediately offered Zofran up as an alternative (which was one of the hinted medications), so I&rsquo;ve tried that for a day now and it seems to help quite a bit more!<br>Will wrap this up quickly - Peace &amp; Love all you wonderful people!Jay, Denise, Connor &amp; Riley&nbsp;</p>
