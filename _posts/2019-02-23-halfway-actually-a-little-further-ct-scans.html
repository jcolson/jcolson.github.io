<p>February 13th was my eight chemotherapy infusion.&nbsp; Four more to go.&nbsp; I can do anything four times.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re crossing our fingers that the folfirinox will do the job and that will be the end of chemo.&nbsp; &#x1f91e;<br>Denise, Connor, Riley and myself flew to Houston this past week in order to get another CT scan and meet with Dr. Katz to review it and the CT scan that I had in Dublin (I had uploaded it to their CT scan importer the previous week).<br>The good news:&nbsp; No Evidence of Disease (NED) &mdash; after reviewing both CT scans, Dr. Katz has concluded that there is no evidence of any additional cancer growth.&nbsp; This, of course, doesn&rsquo;t mean that there is definitely no cancer growth, but it DOES mean that there is nothing that he can &lsquo;see&rsquo; (no visible tumors, etc).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go back in May (after my final chemotherapy treatment) for another CT scan and review.<br>&#x1f389;&nbsp; WOOHOO!&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x1f389;<br>We stayed with my wonderful parents again and got some great visit time in.&nbsp; We actually made it to iFly (indoor skydiving) and I think Louise and my mom both committed to doing it with us next time!&nbsp; &#x1f61c;&nbsp; Denise&rsquo;s parents flew to Houston to see all of us as well.&nbsp; It was a wonderful visit.&nbsp; We were lucky enough to have lunch with Uncle Ray and Aunt Bonnie at Bodegas!&nbsp; (and great Mexican food was had!).<br>Will keep it short and sweet this time.<br>Peace and Love to all you beautiful people!Jay Colson</p>
