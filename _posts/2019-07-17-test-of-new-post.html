<p>I was just testing an email integration and didn't mean to spam everyone!</p>

<p>I'm headed to Houston this next week (July 22nd) for a '90 day' checkup (CT scan and bloods review).  My last checkup was 'clean' and I've been concentrating on getting my weight back up (maybe a little too good ... Denise says I should get back on my 'normal' diet and stop eating hotwings and cheeseburgers!)</p>

<p>I'll send an update after next week, that will hopefully be ALL GOOD NEWS!</p>
