<p>Not too much craziness has transpired over the last two weeks.<br>My wonderfully thoughtful friends,&nbsp;colleagues and families from Crossfit Threefold and Synchronoss participated in the Purple Stride in NJ on my behalf. &nbsp;Such a humbling and lovely experience. &nbsp;The team ended up raising enough money to get a &rsquo;third place&rsquo; 'Passion Team&rsquo; placing!</p>

<p>Probably one of the more interesting items: I&rsquo;ve lost my hair. &nbsp;A couple of days after my second chemotherapy treatment I started noticing lots of hair on my pillow each morning, as well as extra hair in my hands after washing my hair. &nbsp;Riley went to the gym with me on Saturday (December 1st) and afterwards we stopped by the barber so the lads at Grafton Barber could use the clippers on me! &nbsp;She wanted to follow suite and do the same, but I convinced her to hold off on that one :-) &nbsp;Loosing my hair was something that I was expecting at some point, although it would have been nice if it could&rsquo;ve held out a little further into winter (head gets cold quick now, HA!).</p>

<p>My last chemotherapy session was at St. Vincent&rsquo;s on Wednesday (December 5th). I&rsquo;ve had a bit less &ldquo;chemo brain&rdquo; this weekend than the last two sessions, this is great news! &nbsp;I believe it&rsquo;s primarily contributed to my Angel (Denise) keeping me hydrated and full of calories. &nbsp;I hear &ldquo;drink&rdquo;, &ldquo;eat&rdquo; more now than I&rsquo;ve ever heard &#x1f642;<br>As your fitness,&nbsp;I&rsquo;m definitely not back to working out on any type of dependable schedule, but I do get to the gym when I feel as though it won&rsquo;t negatively affect my energy levels later in the day. &nbsp;That equates (unfortunately) to about 3-4 times to the gym every two weeks. &nbsp;I have been continuing to walk at least 2-5km every day; so at least that&rsquo;s something.<br>My weight has steadily dropped since all of this began. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m actually down to about 75 KG from around 91 KG. &nbsp;I think I&rsquo;ve stabilized at this point, it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to get enough calories in especially when I&rsquo;m not as active either. &nbsp;It is important, however, that I keep my weight up, otherwise it affects the quantity of the chemotherapy drugs that are used.<br>This was a great weekend! &nbsp;We got the Christmas tree up, lit and decorated! &nbsp;Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Seasons Greetings to all you amazing people!</p>
