<p>My initial outlook on the chemotherapy sessions was this: &ldquo;I can do ANYTHING 12 times.&rdquo; &nbsp;Since there are 12 scheduled chemo 
    sessions. &nbsp;The interesting thing is that this saying is actually adapted from my fitness training. &nbsp;Most horrendous, suffer-inducing 
    workouts generally have time caps or a specific number or reps or sets that are &lsquo;required&rsquo; to &lsquo;Rx&rsquo; the workout 
    (complete the workout in the prescribed fashion). &nbsp;In the middle of these workouts I would always tell myself that I can do 
    ANYTHING &ldquo;n&rdquo; number of times; it was an easy way to mentally armour oneself against the pain. &nbsp;I can safely say, 
    that, so far, this mental game seems to be working rather well for my current challenges!</p>

<p>Chemo round five is "done and dusted&rdquo;, as the Irish saying goes (well, I guess it&rsquo;s a UK saying, but while in Rome). &nbsp;Denise and I 
    believe that i&rsquo;ve actually gotten a bit better at handling the chemo each time &hellip; this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the side effects are 
    less, just that we&rsquo;re able to anticipate the effects and properly deploy counter measures at the proper times. Nausea being the biggest 
    culprit. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure if you have ever experienced ongoing nausea, but let me assure you, it&rsquo;s nothing to take lightly. &nbsp;
    It&rsquo;s amazing how a bit of nausea can completely derail a daily routine. &nbsp;It makes it very difficult, indeed, almost impossible to 
    properly concentrate on complex tasks, and sometimes even simple ones. &nbsp;Imagine getting off the shittiest, sickness inducing roller coaster 
    you can think of and then being required to take a technical test of some sort.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not getting to the gym nearly as much as I had &lsquo;planned&rsquo; to &hellip; the fatigue is very real, I&rsquo;m definitely getting more sleep these 
    days than I think I&rsquo;ve ever gotten in my entire life &#x1f642; &nbsp;Since I&rsquo;m not getting as much gym time, I have been trying to make sure 
    that I get good walks in every day. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also attempted to join the &ldquo;Float Life&rdquo;; I purchased the OneWheel and have been trying 
    to get out on that a bit to keep my coordination up.</p>

<p>We had a wonderful Christmas and New Years holiday, and hope all of you did as well! Denise, Connor and Riley had great visits from Santa and hopefully I&rsquo;ll 
    be reaping the benefits of their gifts soon! &nbsp;Riley got a new acoustic guitar and lessons (thanks gma and poppop)! &nbsp;I fully expect her to perform a full 
    on concert for me within a few weeks. Connor got a new SLR, as he was using Denise&rsquo;s old one which was definitely a bit dated. &nbsp;So we should have 
    amazing photos to share with everyone soon enough!<br>We have an exciting guest here over New Years, Brynn Hughes flew from PA to hang out with us (well, to be 
    honest, mostly with Connor). &nbsp;She mentioned that Connor did an &ldquo;ok&rdquo; job as a tourist guide for Dublin - so the next time one of you lovely 
    people decide to visit Dublin, you won&rsquo;t even need a guide! &nbsp;We also had a very cute little visitor over the holidays, &ldquo;Kaia&rdquo;, a cute 
    little 3 year old bundle of energy (adorable dog in the picture above). &nbsp;Denise and the kids became very attached, as she was quite a little snuggle 
    bug. &nbsp;So, now I know what type of puppy to get Denise when we &ldquo;settle down&rdquo; somewhere &#x1f609;</p>
