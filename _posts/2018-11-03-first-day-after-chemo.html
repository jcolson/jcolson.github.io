<p>So this is Saturday, the day after my first chemo (FOLFIRINOX) treatment. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve still got the pump on and will have it until tomorrow 
    (Sunday) afternoon when I go back to the hospital to get it unhooked.<br>The pump is administrating the&nbsp;Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2.<br>I was 
    physically wiped out yesterday evening. &nbsp;Passed out and didn&rsquo;t awake until almost 8am (I normally get up around 5:30am on any given 
    day).<br>This morning I felt decent, way better than I expected. &nbsp;I actually got to the gym (nothing crazy). &nbsp;It is now 5pm and for 
    the past couple of hours I&rsquo;ve been getting progressively more nauseas &hellip; however, that could be my standard nausea that I have been 
    working through with the whipple procedure.<br>I didn&rsquo;t take my pantium or dexamethasone until around 4pm.<br>I was pretty concerned about 
    the oxaliplatin&rsquo;s (folfirinox cocktail drug) &ldquo;cold touch&rdquo; side effect, as winter is kicking in and everything I touch seems 
    to be cold! &nbsp;I have noticed a slight increase in sensation on touching cold things, but nothing shocking or painful, which is 
    fantastic. &nbsp;I have noticed that upon starting to eat that my jaw &lsquo;locks up&rsquo; in a type of &lsquo;sweet/sour&rsquo; pain that you 
    would get from eating something extremely sweet and/or sour. &nbsp;Seems to be worse for cold/cool food/drink.<br>I don&rsquo;t seem to be 
    allergic to any of the drugs yet, which is fantastic! &nbsp;Any &ldquo;small wonders&rdquo; right now are welcome.<br>My mouth was definitely 
    on the &ldquo;drier&rdquo; side the entire day &hellip; I know I haven&rsquo;t hydrated enough either. &nbsp;Something to keep an eye on.<br>I 
    definitely feel a bit &ldquo;loopy&rdquo; or &ldquo;scattered&rdquo; today. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not as easy to concentrate on tasks that have multiple 
    steps it seems (debugging a network VPN issue, helping my daughter with her website, etc, etc).<br>So far, so good!<br><strong>Peace and Love all 
        you wonderful people!</strong><br>And here&rsquo;s some clipart for the day &#x1f642; &nbsp;My attempt at humor, and should be appreciated 
        here in Ireland at least!<br><img class="wp-image-522" style="width: 150px;" src="/assets/cancer-in-the-dick.png" alt=""></p>
