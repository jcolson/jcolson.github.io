These are some random links to opensource and "leisure time" software development stuff that I write.  Everything from Java, Android, shell scripting, Objective C, Swift, Python and PHP.

## Miscellaneous Development

### D&D Vault Bot for Discord

### Geoloc - microservice

[Geoloc](https://github.com/jcolson/geoloc){:target="_blank"} - [Golang]{:target="_blank"} - Microservice for returning the reverse geocode information for a Point.
This service is deployable as a docker container and by default uses the geojson data from [Who's On First](https://www.whosonfirst.org/){:target="_blank"}.  This was written as a proof of concept.

### Helpful Shell Scripts

[Helpful Shell Scripts](https://git.sr.ht/~jcolson/random-scripts){:target="_blank"} - [Bash]{:target="_blank"}(mostly) - This repo just has a few helpful bash scripts such as a script that geo-locates you and updates your slack status based on location.  There's a script that displays color-coded timezone information in your terminal.  A script that helps you test bandwidth between two machines.  etc, etc ....

### iloss-ical-gen

[iloss-ical-gen](https://github.com/jcolson/loss-ical-gen){:target="_blank"} - [PHP]{:target="_blank"} - The purpose of the application is to provide an ICS calendar of projected weight loss. The user can recreate the calendar anytime by visiting the page to get a new url or just manipulating the url parameters to values of his/her choosing.  [Use it here.](http://track.karma.net/){:target="_blank"}

### Exchange Rate Alfred workflow
